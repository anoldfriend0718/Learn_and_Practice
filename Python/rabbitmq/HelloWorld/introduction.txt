Producing means nothing more than sending. A program that sends messages is a producer 

A queue is the name for a post box which lives inside RabbitMQ. Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications, they can only be stored inside a queue. A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, it's essentially a large message buffer. Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue

Consuming has a similar meaning to receiving. A consumer is a program that mostly waits to receive messages:

In this part of the tutorial we'll write two small programs in Python; a producer (sender) that sends a single message, and a consumer (receiver) that receives messages and prints them out. It's a "Hello World" of messaging.

RabbitMQ libraries
RabbitMQ speaks multiple protocols. This tutorial uses AMQP 0-9-1, which is an open, protocol for messaging. There are a number of clients for RabbitMQ in many different languages. In this tutorial series we're going to use Pika 1.0.0, which is the Python client recommended by the RabbitMQ team. To install it you can use the pip package management tool:

pip install pika --upgrade
